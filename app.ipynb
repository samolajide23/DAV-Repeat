    "## Theoretical Framework:\n",
    "This assessment aims to create a \"Quality of Life Index\" by combining multiple indicators from the World Happiness Report (2019) and the Human Development Report (2015). The goal of the Quality of Life Index is to measure and compare the overall well-being of people across different countries. This index takes into account several aspects which include economic stability, health and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this Problem?\n",
    "Quality of life is very important for human development and improvement in society. The usual economic indicators like GDP per capita only give a limited view by focusing primarily on economic performance. However, quality of life is a multifaceted concept that encompasses not only economic factors but also health, education, and social well-being. A composite index that brings together these parts will provide a more comprehensive and deep understanding for those in charge of making policies, governments, as well as worldwide groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Indicators:\n",
    "The Quality of Life Index includes the following indicators, because they are important for measuring various elements that make up a good life:\n",
    "\n",
    "### GDP per Capita:\n",
    "Measures the average economic production per person, giving insight into how well the country is doing economically. It is a commonly used measure of economic stability and living standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: World Happiness Report (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthy Life Expectancy:\n",
    "Measures the average number of years a person can expect to live in good health, which shows how well healthcare systems perform and the overall health of the populace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: World Happiness Report (2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Life Expectancy at Birth:\n",
    "Represents the average number of years a newborn is expected to survive if current mortality rates continue, acting as an important gauge for a country’s healthcare and living conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: Human Development Report (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Years of Education:\n",
    "Represents the average number of years of schooling that people aged 25 and more have completed, this can be seen as an indicator of how much education and human capital exist in the country's population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: Human Development Report (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita:\n",
    "Represents the total income earned by a country’s residents, providing a broader perspective on economic well-being beyond domestic production alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Source: Human Development Report (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appropriateness of Selected Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected indicators present a wide and fair perspective on the different elements that affect life quality. Economic signs like GDP per head and GNI per individual give understanding into economic conditions, while health indicators such as life expectancy and healthy life expectancy highlight the importance of good health and wellness. Education is also included by considering educational achievement, acknowledging its part in bettering life results.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are interconnected, providing a multi-dimensional evaluation of the quality of life. For example, higher education levels often lead to better employment opportunities, which in turn can increase income and improve access to healthcare, ultimately extending life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from reliable reports- World Happiness Report (2019) and Human Development Report (2015). This ensures that it is accurate, dependable and consistent across the different indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quality of Life Index was created because we require a broader way of measurement for well-being that is better than usual economic gauges. \n",
    "By using the data on economic output, health and education, this index becomes a comprehensive tool for comparing life quality in various nations. It reveals both strong points and drawbacks within each country as well as guiding worldwide development efforts."
